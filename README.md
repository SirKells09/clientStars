# Shooting Stars
Shooting Stars is a productivity tool aimed to provide a structured environment for children with special needs. The application allows parents, care givers and teachers the ability to set daily goals to aid in providing a visual representation of a child’s day, teach important skills and encourage independence.  

The child is awarded a star each time a goal is completed and the stars are tracked using a points system to allow the parent/guardian to reward the child once a certain amount of stars have been earned.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.2.
